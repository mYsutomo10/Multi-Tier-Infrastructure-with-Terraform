# Multi-Tier Infrastructure with Terraform on GCP

This repository contains Terraform configurations to deploy a complete 3-tier web application infrastructure (frontend, backend, database) on Google Cloud Platform with auto-scaling capabilities, high availability, cost optimization, and enhanced security features.

## Architecture Overview

The infrastructure consists of the following components:

![Architecture Diagram](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400?text=Multi-Tier+Architecture+Diagram)

1. **VPC Network** with segregated subnets and security rules
2. **Frontend Tier**:
   - Auto-scaling instance group of web servers across multiple zones
   - Global HTTP load balancer with Cloud Armor protection
   - Health checks and auto-healing
3. **Backend Tier**:
   - Auto-scaling instance group of API servers
   - Internal load balancer
   - Spring Boot application with proper health endpoints
4. **Database Tier**:
   - Cloud SQL PostgreSQL instance with high availability configuration
   - Read replicas for scaling read operations
   - Private connectivity and automated backups

## Prerequisites

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) v1.0+
- Google Cloud Platform account
- GCP Service Account with appropriate permissions
- Service Account key file (JSON)
- [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) (optional)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/multi-tier-terraform.git
   cd multi-tier-terraform
   ```

2. **Configure your GCP credentials**:
   - Update the `terraform.tfvars` file with your:
     - GCP project ID
     - Path to your service account key file
     - Other customization options as needed

3. **Initialize Terraform**:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

4. **Select your environment workspace**:
   ```bash
   terraform workspace select dev
   # Or create a new workspace
   terraform workspace new staging
   ```

5. **Preview the changes**:
   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```

6. **Deploy the infrastructure**:
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

7. **Access your application**:
   After successful deployment, Terraform will output:
   - Frontend URL (publicly accessible)
   - Backend API URL (internal)
   - Database connection information

## High Availability Features

This infrastructure is designed for high availability:

1. **Multi-zone Deployment**:
   - Frontend and backend tiers deploy across multiple zones within a region
   - Automatic failover if a zone becomes unavailable

2. **Regional Database Configuration**:
   - Cloud SQL configured with regional high availability
   - Automatic failover to standby instance
   - Point-in-time recovery enabled

3. **Zero-downtime Deployments**:
   - Rolling updates with health-based instance replacement
   - Configurable surge and unavailable instance limits

4. **Global Load Balancing**:
   - Intelligent routing based on user location and backend health
   - Automatic failover to healthy instances

5. **Disaster Recovery**:
   - Automated backups with configurable retention periods
   - Cross-region replication options for critical data

## Scaling Capabilities

The infrastructure scales both vertically and horizontally:

1. **Intelligent Auto-scaling**:
   - Scale based on multiple metrics (CPU, request count, custom metrics)
   - Predictive scaling for anticipated traffic patterns
   - Minimum instances configured to handle baseline traffic

2. **Database Scaling**:
   - Read replicas to scale read operations
   - Automatic storage scaling
   - Connection pooling to manage high connection counts

3. **Regional and Multi-regional Options**:
   - Configurable for multi-region deployment
   - Global load balancing for traffic distribution

4. **Stateless Application Design**:
   - All application tiers designed for horizontal scaling
   - Shared state managed through external services

## Cost Optimization

Several strategies are implemented to optimize costs:

1. **Resource Right-sizing**:
   - Environment-specific instance types (smaller for dev/staging)
   - Scalable resources that grow only as needed

2. **Preemptible/Spot Instances**:
   - Optional use of preemptible VMs for non-critical workloads
   - Significant cost savings for suitable workloads

3. **Autoscaling Efficiency**:
   - Scale-to-zero options for non-production environments
   - Schedule-based scaling for predictable traffic patterns

4. **Storage Optimization**:
   - Tiered storage for different data needs
   - Lifecycle policies for older data

5. **Committed Use Discounts**:
   - Recommendations for stable workload components

## Security Measures

Comprehensive security is implemented across all layers:

1. **Network Security**:
   - Private Google Access for API calls
   - Service-level network segmentation
   - Granular firewall rules with logging
   - VPC Service Controls to prevent data exfiltration

2. **Identity and Access Management**:
   - Least privilege service accounts
   - Automated key rotation
   - Separation of duties through IAM roles

3. **Application Security**:
   - Cloud Armor WAF protection
   - DDoS protection
   - HTTPS enforcement
   - Secret Manager integration for sensitive data

4. **Database Security**:
   - Private connectivity only (no public IP)
   - Encrypted storage and communications
   - IAM database authentication

5. **Monitoring and Compliance**:
   - Audit logging
   - Security Command Center integration
   - Automated compliance scanning
   - Infrastructure-as-Code security scanning

## Maintenance

### Updating the Infrastructure

To update the infrastructure after changing configurations:

```bash
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

### Implementing Changes Safely

For production environments:

```bash
# Create a plan file
terraform plan -out=changes.plan

# Review the plan file with team members

# Apply only after approval
terraform apply changes.plan
```

### Destroying the Infrastructure

To tear down the entire infrastructure:

```bash
terraform destroy
```

> **Warning**: This will destroy all resources created by this Terraform configuration.

## Monitoring and Observability

The infrastructure includes:

1. **Health Monitoring**:
   - Instance and service health checks
   - Alerting for degraded performance
   - Custom dashboard creation

2. **Logging**:
   - Centralized log management
   - Log-based metrics and alerts
   - Audit logs for security monitoring

3. **Performance Metrics**:
   - Request latency tracking
   - Resource utilization monitoring
   - Database performance insights

4. **Cost Monitoring**:
   - Budget alerts
   - Resource utilization analysis
   - Recommendations for optimization

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Deployment Failures**:
   - Check service account permissions
   - Verify quota limitations in your GCP project
   - Review Terraform state for locked resources

2. **Connectivity Issues**:
   - Inspect VPC and firewall configurations
   - Check service networking for private connectivity
   - Validate DNS configuration

3. **Performance Problems**:
   - Check instance sizing and resource constraints
   - Review load balancer configuration
   - Inspect database query performance
